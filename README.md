# Hand-Cricket-Game-Java


**Description:**  
The **Hand Cricket Game** is a simple Java-based console application where a player competes against the computer.
The game follows the basic rules of hand cricket, where both the player and the computer choose a number between **1 and 10** in each turn.
If the numbers match, the batsman is out; otherwise, the chosen number is added to the batsman's score.
The game consists of two innings, where the roles of batting and bowling are swapped after the first innings. 
The player with the highest score at the end wins.  

**Technologies & Concepts Used:**  
- **Java Core Concepts** – Implemented using loops, conditional statements, and functions.  
- **Random Class** – Used to generate computer's moves dynamically for a fair gameplay experience.  
- **Loops & Conditionals** – Controlled game flow, turn-based logic, and winning conditions.
